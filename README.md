# Unit Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito

This guide introduces unit testing concepts using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**, with a focus on improving code reliability and maintainability. Additionally, **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)** principles are discussed as a complementary approach to writing tests.

## What Are Unit Tests?
Unit tests validate small pieces of code (usually individual methods) to ensure they work as expected in isolation. They help identify bugs early, improve code quality, and ease future changes.

## JUnit 5
JUnit 5 is the latest version of the JUnit framework, widely used for writing unit tests in Java.

### Key Concepts
- **Test lifecycle**: Tests can use setup and teardown methods to handle resources before and after tests.
- **Assertions**: Core validation methods that confirm test outcomes.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Enables running tests with different sets of data inputs.
- **Test Suites**: Organizes multiple tests into a single suite for easier management.

## Mockito
Mockito is used to mock dependencies and isolate units of code.

### Key Concepts
- **Mocking**: Simulate the behavior of real objects.
- **Stubbing**: Predetermine the behavior of mocked methods.
- **Verification**: Ensures that the mocked methods are invoked with the correct parameters.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
BDD is a software development approach focused on the behavior of the system rather than its internal structure. It enhances communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders by framing tests in a common language.

### BDD Structure:
- **GIVEN**: Defines the initial conditions of the test.
- **WHEN**: Specifies the action or event that triggers the behavior being tested.
- **THEN**: Verifies the expected outcome of the action.

BDD helps shift the focus from technical details to what the software should do, making tests more readable and understandable to all stakeholders.

## Best Practices
- Ensure unit tests are independent of external systems (databases, network calls).
- Test for both expected and edge case scenarios.
- Focus on one logical unit of work per test.
- Write tests before implementation (TDD or BDD approach).

## Benefits of Unit Testing
- **Fast feedback**: Quickly identifies defects.
- **Refactoring confidence**: Safely refactor code without breaking functionality.
- **Better design**: Encourages decoupled, modular code.

## Conclusion
Unit tests using JUnit 5, Mockito, and BDD principles enhance the robustness of your code, encourage better designs, and facilitate communication between technical and non-technical team members.
